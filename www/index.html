    <h1>About</h1>
    <p class="lead">
      <b>HPCRAN</b> is an R Archive Network, or software repository, for
      HPC packages for the
      <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R programming language</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p class="lead">
      You can install an <b>HPCRAN</b> package via the usual
      <code>install.packages()</code> if you set the <code>repos</code> argument
      to <code>https://hpcran.org</code>. However, some <b>HPCRAN</b> packages
      have CRAN dependencies, so we recommend something like this:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
      options(repos=structure(c(
        HPCRAN="https://hpcran.org/",
        CRAN="https://cran.rstudio.com/"
      )))
    </code></pre>
    
    <p class="lead">
      Then you don't need to set the <code>repos</code> argument. You can put
      this in your <code>~/.Rprofile</code> file.
      <br><br>
      If you are on Windows or Mac, you will need to set
      <code>type="source"</code> in your <code>install.packages()</code> call.
      You will of course need to be able to build packages from source.
      Some packages, such as those that make use of GPUs, may not be installable
      on non-Linux platforms.
    </p>
    
    <br>
    <h3>Why HPCRAN?</h3>
    <p class="lead">
    <b>HPCRAN</b> is an R package archive specifically for HPC packages, in
    contrast to the CRAN which is the <i>comprehensive</i> package archive. The
    CRAN is meant for packages with a fairly universal appeal. However, software
    designed for HPC environments often won't work on Windows/Mac, or uses
    boutique hardware like
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gpgpu">GPUs</a>,
    or strange software like
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface">MPI</a>,
    or uses programming models unknown to the outside world like
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPMD">SPMD</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p class="lead">
    Packages with exactly one of these kinds of qualities <i>might</i> be
    allowed onto CRAN with a special exception to the CRAN rules. In order to
    distribute their packages on CRAN, HPC package authors are sometimes forced
    to ship entire copies of standard HPC libraries to the CRAN in order to
    conform &mdash; which for the record is completely insane. Packages with
    multiple of these qualities will likely be turned away, and even
    already-published packages may be kicked off the CRAN as their publishing
    standards continually increase.
    </p>
    
    <p class="lead">
    While increasingly stringent rules for publishing on CRAN are ultimately a
    good thing on average, it makes publishing HPC packages unreasonably
    difficult for the reasons outlined above. The <b>HPCRAN</b> is meant to give
    HPC package authors for R a CRAN-like place to publish packages which would
    otherwise be a good fit for CRAN, were the rules not so stringent.
    </p>
